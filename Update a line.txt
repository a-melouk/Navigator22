Steps for updating a line:

------------ We update a line by updating its segments ------------

let from = segment.from
let to = segment.to
let path = segment.path

after changing the whole segment

1- getModifiedFrom()
2- getModifiedTo()
3- getModifiedPath()

Update stations collection (from & to) by id if exists, otherwise add them
Update every segment (from & to) containing modifiedFrom() & modifiedTo()
